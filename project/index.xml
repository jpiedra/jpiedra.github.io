      <description>To ease the process of deploying static websites or front-end SPA&amp;rsquo;s to Amazon Web Services&amp;rsquo; S3 buckets, I wrote some Powershell scripts that handle configuring a new S3 bucket to use for website hosting, as well as uploading content of various standard types (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the bucket afterwards. The scripts use Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Command-Line Interface.</description>

      <description>I made this for fun! When I crossed launching a gaming server off of my bucket list, I decided it would be interesting to keep a leaderboard of all the players who have played on it and their logged scores to date.
The front-end is a Vue.js Single Page Application (SPA) that uses a custom Bootstrap theme for styling. The SPA consists of several Vue components that accept user input for searching and paging through logged scores, then issues the respective API calls to get the results requested by said user.</description>

      <description>I used Bootstrap and Susy grids to implement a redesign of a video portal page for Louise Blouin Media. Using Bootstrap was a great way to get useful features and components out of the box, such as the navigation bar and grid system. Susy grids were also very useful, as the requirements for this responsive design called for a grid system that could display content on anywhere from three to two columns, or a single column on small devices.</description>
