	<p class="page-paragraph">GiveMeItems! gives you the ability to reward yourself in-game, by overriding the properties of enemies to drop specified items upon death. And with an in-game interface, choosing those items becomes more convenient than editing an .ini file - which would involve closing then re-starting the game.</p>
