		<h1>About Me</h1>
	</div>
	<p>I graduated from Brooklyn College in 2014. My Bachelor's Degree consists of a minor in Computer Science, with a focus on Multimedia Design. In addition to a solid background in programming concepts and ideas, I continue every day to consume and apply new technologies and frameworks in web development. I enjoy the challenge - and reward - of mastering something new.</p>

	<p class="page-title-2">Welcome!</p> 
	<p class="page-paragraph">I am Jonathan Piedra, a graduate of Brooklyn College. I am a web developer with an ever-expanding interest for all things programming. Here you will find academic, professional and personal projects, with work involving modern tools of the trade (jQuery, Node.js, JavaScript), to the odds and ends of bygone eras (Unrealscript 1). </p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">My experiences thus far studying computer programming began with my decision to take introductory courses during the spring 2013 semester. Since then, my studies have involved working with and utilizing the following:</p>	
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li>Unrealscript</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Netlogo</li>
		<li>HTML5 and CSS</li>
		<li>jQuery</li>
		<li>Bootstrap</li>
		<li>Node.js</li>
		<li>Express</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	
	<p class="page-paragraph">This website serves as a repository for anything I do or have done relating to programming. Here you can find information on such projects, as well as more information about me.</p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-title-2">JavaCrypt</p> 
	<p class="page-paragraph">What would a browser-based dungeon crawler look like, where the player could also take a role in uploading level layouts and contribute directly to the experiences of others? This personal project endeavours to find out, and will do so through utilizing front- and back-end tools such as jQuery, Node.js and Express.</p>
	<p class="page-paragraph">To have a look at an early demo of the game, <a href="https://javacrypt.herokuapp.com/">visit the JavaCrypt app page hosted through Heroku here.</a></p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-title-2">HTML Primer</p> 
	<p class="page-paragraph">HTML Primer is a project I am currently developing for one of my senior courses in multimedia design. The web-based application currently features a dynamically-generating quiz on HTML5 elements, made possible through jQuery, JavaScript and JSON objects. It also links to other useful resources where the user can learn more about making HTML websites; in the future, a series of basic instructional videos will be available as well.</p>
	<p class="page-paragraph">To learn more, <a href="{{site.url}}/webapp_index.html">visit the HTML Primer homepage,</a> or view the app <a href="{{site.url}}/app_new.html">here.</a> </p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-title-2">Unrealscript</p> 
	<p class="page-paragraph">As a programming student, I find myself searching for ways in which I can apply my skills to subjects and areas I may already be familiar with, as well as those I know little to nothing about.</p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">Unrealscript is a programming language influenced by C++ and Java. It was developed in 1998 by Tim Sweeney and, since then, has been the foundation for many popular games. Considering I owned two of those games, programming in Unrealscript has become a personal interest of mine and one of the ways I apply such knowledge to problems I consider and subsequently attempt to solve.</p>	
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">A current project I am working on, <a href="{{site.url}}/gmi.html">GiveMeItems,</a> is my latest example of how I use what I know about programming to learn a new language, as well as work with that language in an interesting way - in this case, to add new gameplay to an old favorite.</p>
