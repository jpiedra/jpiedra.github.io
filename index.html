	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">Welcome to my website! I am Jonathan Piedra, currently a senior at Brooklyn College. I plan on graduating in the Spring of 2015. My academic interests include computer programming; I am currently pursuing a minor in the field, with a concentration on multimedia computing and design. </p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">My experiences thus far studying computer programming began with my decision to take introductory courses during the spring 2013 semester. Since then, my studies have involved working with and utilizing the following languages:</p>	
	</br>
	<ul>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li>Processing</li>
		<li>Netlogo</li>
		<li>HTML5 and CSS</li>
	</ul>
	</br>
	<p class="page-title-2">Unrealscript</p> 
	<p class="page-paragraph">As a programming student, I find myself searching for ways in which I can apply my skills to subjects and areas I may already be familiar with. </p>
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">Unrealscript is a programming language influenced by C++ and Java. It was developed in 1998 by Tim Sweeney and, since then, has been the foundation for many popular games. Considering I owned two of those games, programming in Unrealscript has become a personal interest of mine and one of the ways I apply such knowledge to problems I consider and subsequently attempt to solve.</p>	
	</br>
	<p class="page-paragraph">A current project I am working on, <a href="{{site.url}}/gmi.html">GiveMeItems,</a> is my latest example of how I use what I know about programming to learn a new language, as well as work with that language in an interesting way - in this case, to add new gameplay to an old favorite.</p>
