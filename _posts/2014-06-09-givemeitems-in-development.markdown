<p class="page-paragraph">Unrealscript is a programming language influenced by C++ and Java. It was developed in 1998 by Tim Sweeney and, since then, has been the foundation for many popular games. Considering I owned two of those games, programming in Unrealscript has become a personal interest of mine and one of the ways I apply such knowledge to problems I consider and subsequently attempt to solve.</p>	
<p class="page-paragraph">A current project I am working on, <a href="{{site.url}}/gmi.html">GiveMeItems,</a> is my latest example of how I use what I know about programming to learn a new language, as well as work with that language in an interesting way - in this case, to add new gameplay to an old favorite.</p>
