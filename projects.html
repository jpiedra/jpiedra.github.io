			<h3>JavaCrypt</h3>
			<p>A browser-based game rendered through an HTML5 canvas. The site hosting the game serves the purpose of an interface for playing the game and uploading data, and is developed as a MEAN stack application (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js). Players traverse several dungeons that are generated from documents queried from a MongoDB collection. In addition, users can upload plans for new levels that can be randomly generated during gameplay. <a href="https://javacrypt.herokuapp.com">Try JavaCrypt here.</a></p>

			<h3>HTML Primer</h3>
			<p>A small project submitted for a course in Multimedia Applications. HTML Primer is an introductory app for learning the basic structure of an HTML5 page. Features include a drag-and-drop portion, and a quiz that populates questions and potential answers using JSON-formatted data obtained and stored procedurally by means of a Python script, Scrapy. The app was made using jQuery mobile, and renders well on computers as well as mobile devices. <a href="{{site.url}}/html_primer.html">View the project here.</a></p>

			<h3>GiveMeItems!</h3>
			<p>GiveMeItems! is an addon for Unreal Tournament which allows in-game addition of Inventory items (health, armor, etc.) for game types which use ScriptedPawns (AI-driven monsters and enemies). The addon checks a default property of all ScriptedPawns, the DropWhenKilled property, to see whether or not that property has been set to an Inventory item. If it has been left unfilled, then an item is randomly selected for that property from an array of objects (of type Inventory), which are set through user-input during the game. In addition, a GUI component performs checks on user submitted data, evaluating whether or not a valid Inventory name has been provided. <a href="https://github.com/jpiedra/GiveMeItems">Download the addon, and view source code here.</a></p>
